14 jokers, 4 vouchers, 4 card packs, 4 potions and 5 editions. more coming soon just you wait

Credit to AlexZgreat for his consumable code otherwise potions would have never existed, Also for a better exprience I recommend that you download betmma's vouchers https://github.com/betmma/my_balatro_mods

Potions are a new consumable type that either has a good, bad or no effect depending on rng

Disclaimer: only works for steamodded 1.0.0
